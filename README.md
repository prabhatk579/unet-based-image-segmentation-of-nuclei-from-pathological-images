Image segmentation is a technique of breaking down a digital image into several parts (sets of pixels, also known as image objects) in computer vision and digital Image processing. 
Image segmentation aims to simplify and transform an image’s representation into something more relevant and easier to evaluate. 
Image segmentation can find objects and boundaries (lines, curves, and so on) in photographs. Image segmentation produces segments encompass ing the entire image or a set of contours taken from the image. 
Every pixel in a segment has the same characteristic or computed feature, such as color, intensity, or texture. Adjacent areas have substantially varied colors when it comes to the exact attributes. Image segmentation can be used for Medical Imaging, object detection, pedestrian detection, face detection, brake light detection, locating objects in satellite images (roads, forests, crops, etc.), video surveillance, etc. 
U-Net technique is used for segmentation of the images. The images belong majorly from Medical Imaging Datasets and Object Detection dataset for Semantic Segmentation. We aim to train a model to differentiate various components present in an image with higher accuracy.

**The dataset used is [2018 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018) from kaggle.**

This dataset comprises a vast number of nucleus pictures that have been segmented. The pictures were taken under various circumstances and differences in cell type, magnification, and imaging modality (brightfield vs. fluorescence). The dataset is intended to test an algorithm’s generalization across these differences.
